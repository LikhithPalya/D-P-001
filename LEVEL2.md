## Task 1 - Multisections

![](https://d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/pictures/files/39897/original.JPG?1404132832)

A golden ellipse of minor axis 100mm, a golden section triangle of base side 100mm and a golden rectangle of breadth 100mm are placed over one other with a 100mm gap. Join these shapes using the principles of multi-sections.

Design a simple boat hull using surface and wireframe modelling in AutoCAD. Use your creativity to make the boat. More than the specifications, we expect you to learn the principles of wireframe and surface modelling to make a prototype of a simple functional boat. Its functionality and aesthetics will count.

## Task 4 - 3D Printing from scratch

&gt; It's pointless to have a nice clean desk, because it means you're not doing anything. ~ M. Kaku

With the advances in mathematics &amp; computing, humankind is now capable of having the technology of additive manufacturing, more colloquially referred to as 3D printing. 

Makers need not know coding for 3D Printing. It has been simplified more than ever, with the perks of GUI. In this task, you will be equipped with the skill of 3D printing from scratch.

Using Ultimaker Cura, splice the .stl file of the boat designed by surface modelling. Length of the model - 50mm, gyroid infill of 25%.

## Task 5 - Sheet metal development 

A sheet metal development serves to open up an object that has been rolled, folded, or a combination of both, and makes that object appear to be spread out on a plane or flat surface. Sheet metal layout drawings are based on three types of development: parallel, radial, and triangulation.


Develop the following 

1. Cone
2. Truncated pyramid
3. Truncated cylinder

Use any size of sheet to do so and using appropriate dimensions while doing so.

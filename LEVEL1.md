(Hint: You can refer Task 4 and Task 5) 

## Task 7 - LED on a Breadboard
 Build a very simple circuit which lights up a single Light Emitting Diode (LED) by clicking [here](https://startingelectronics.org/beginners/start-electronics-now/tut1-breadboard-circuits/).

Once you finish performing the experiment, try lighting up larger LED sequences( 3,4,5 LEDs, etc.)
The linked article uses AA batteries to power the LED. However, you’ll be using a breadboard power supply, which provides different voltages(5V and 3.3V). Hence the resistor values will change. Find out how to calculate resistor values by clicking [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJlzTaTU7LY).


## Task 8 - Transistor as a switch
Learn to operate a transistor as a switch by biasing it appropriately. Click [here](https://circuits-diy.com/how-to-use-a-transistor-bc547-as-a-switch/) to know more!

Explore how a Datasheet plays an important role in understanding the functioning of a device by visiting the "Datasheets are your friends!" resource article.


## Task 9 - Flash an LED using a transistor
Blink an LED using 2 npn transistors, a few resistors and capacitors by clicking [here](https://circuitspedia.com/simple-blinking-led-flasher-circuit-diagram-using-transistors/)

Try playing around with different resistor-capacitor combinations to get different flashing frequencies.

## Task 10 - Darkness detector using LDR
Create a circuit that turns on an LED when the room is dark. Click [here](http://elonics.in/breadboard-projects/light-sensor-and-darkness-detector-circuit-using-ldr-transistor
) to know more.

Similarly, design a light detector by biasing the transistor appropriately.


Try building the circuit entirely using the circuit diagram. Don’t use the video guide if you don’t need it!

## Task 11 - Convert your drawings on paper to CAD
Explore the Computer Aided Design tools at your disposal and try to replicate these drawings [link1](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/492649943350394/), [link2](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/19140367154199215/), [link3](https://in.pinterest.com/pin/290341507231609718/).

Once you've successfully completed the above task, let your creativity run wild! Convert a drawing on paper to CAD.


## Task 12 - Simple soldering practice
Practice the soldering activities taught during the hands-on workshop and try to perfect your soldering technique.
Here's a quick refresher [article](https://www.makerspaces.com/how-to-solder/) to get you started.


**Caution:** Handle the soldering equipment with care. Temperatures exceed 200 degrees celsius. Coming in contact may cause severe burns. Make sure to solder in a well ventilated area and avoid breathing in any fumes.
